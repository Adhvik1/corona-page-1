			<h1>What is Coronavirus ?</h1>
			<p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
				Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
				<br><br>
				In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified
				SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
				<br><br>
				COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract
				infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory
				tract (windpipe and lungs).
				<br><br>
				It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections
				range from mild to deadly.
				<br><br>
				SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like
				Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other
				coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for
				otherwise healthy people.

	<div class = "flex1"><div><h1>What is Covid-19</h1><p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild 
		to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with 
		underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more
		 likely to develop serious illness.
<br><br>
		The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it
		 causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based 
		 rub frequently and not touching your face.

			<h1>Prevention</h1>
			<p>Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene,
				washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing
				into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the
				infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public. Physical distancing measures are also
				recommended to prevent transmission. Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected
				are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.</p>
			<p> Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they
				have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.
				Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest
				self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups. Those who may have been
				exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the
				widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible
				exposure</p>

			<h1>Social Distancing</h1>
			<p>
				In public health, social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a set of non-pharmaceutical
				 interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease by maintaining a physical 
				 distance between people and reducing the number of times people come into close contact with each other.
<br><br>
				 Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.
Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.
Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.

		Face mask and hygiene
	</h1>
	<p>
		If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.
In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings.
In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and for activities with 
close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.
<br><br>
People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be fully protected even if they
 are fully vaccinated. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including wearing a 
 well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.
 <br><br>
If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear
 a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.
